    <h1>Amazing Comic Artists</h1>
    <p>Thanks to the Internet, there are so many possibilities for comic artists to connect with one another and share their work. 
        Over time, I’ve come across a number of comic artists that I look up to and admire. 
        These are just a few. </p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="#christine">Christine Mari</a></li>
        <li><a href="#shen">Shen Comix</a></li>
        <li><a href="#alison">Alison Zai</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="christine">Christine Mari</h2>
    <p>Christine Mari is an auto-biographical comic artist.
         Her comics revolve around what it’s like being in your 20s in Japan. 
         When she was 17, she self-published her first graphic novel, Halfway Home: Drawing My Way Through Japan. 
         Two years later, she landed a contract with Tuttle Publishing, which resulted in Diary of a Tokyo Teen. 
         Now, in January 2021, Mari is set to release another self-published graphic novel, Kokoro, a full-length piece of work that showcases the comics she’s gotten widespread attention for on her Instagram. 
         Mari’s work is honest, vulnerable, melancholic and beautiful. 
        Her ability to tell her story so well keeps her readers coming back for more (including myself). </p>

    <h2 id="shen">Shen Comix</h2>
    <p>Shen is one of the most popular comic artists on the internet. 
        His comics are humorous, fun, and overwhelmingly enjoyable. 
        If you ever find yourself down, I recommend checking out his work. 
        His universe of characters (buff winter, tiny gamer, himself, etc.) allows Shen to constantly create new stories and worlds that connect with the reader in just a few panels.</p>

    <h2 id="alison">Alison Zai</h2>
    <p>Calling Alison Zai’s comics humorous is an understatement. 
        Her art tackles many themes in a direct, honest and funny way: love, relationships, work, sadness… the list goes on. 
        Her use of vibrant colors and unique characters makes her comics seem otherworldly, but the irony lies in the fact that her work is so easy to relate to. 
        Her massive following on social media just goes to show how many resonate with her work. 
        There’s a large chance that you might’ve come across her earlier work, when she created comics that featured beans or skeletons as characters. 
        Zai is a graduate from MICA, where she studied illustration. </p>
