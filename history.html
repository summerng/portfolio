    <h1>History of Sequential Art & Comics</h1>

    <p>Comics have existed for centuries. 
        Although comics may seem like a new phenomenon, it’s mainly because superheroes are so closely associated with comic art. 
        However, if we broaden our definition of comic art using the term sequential art: [EFFECT]</p>
        <p>"Images or pictures in a deliberate sequence (2 or more), which are intende to convey information or aesthetic value to the viewer."</p>
    <p>We can better understand the relevance of comic art as a form of storytelling. 
        Under this definition, picture manuscripts, Greek paintings, scrolls, mosaics -- they’re all counted as comics. 
        [EFFECT - button?]</p>
    <p>When the printing press emerged, the world of comics drastically changed. 
        The technology that was available to us made comics way more prevalent in our daily lives - we now digest sequential art, or comics, in the form of photo booth picture strips, instructional diagrams, or even swipeable Instagram posts. 
        Of course, we now also have hand-drawn comics, which you’ll see in your local newspaper or magazine. 
        We have graphic novels, comic books, manga… the list is growing. </p>
    <p>As you can see, comics are not just reserved for superheroes. 
        They’re meant for anybody who’s interested in a good story. 
        What’s great about comics is its uniqueness as a medium. 
        Comics use both words and pictures to tell a story, but the creator does not need to be an expert in writing or drawing to create a good comic. 
        Comics don’t even need to use words all the time to tell a story, nor do they need to feature elaborate drawings on every panel. 
        The malleability of comics allows for endless innovation and creation, so what are you waiting for? 
        Go out there and create your first comic today!</p>
